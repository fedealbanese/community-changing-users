**Abstract**. Even though the Internet and social media have increased
the amount of news and information people can consume, most users are
only exposed to content that reinforces their positions and isolates them
from other ideological communities. This environment has real conse-
quences with great impact on our lives like severe political polarization,
easy spread of fake news, political extremism, hate groups and the lack of
enriching debates, among others. Therefore, encouraging conversations
between different groups of users and breaking the closed community is
of importance for healthy societies. In this paper, we characterize and
study users who change their community on Twitter using natural lan-
guage processing techniques and graph machine learning algorithms. In
particular, we collected 9 million Twitter messages from 1.5 million users
and constructed retweet networks. We identified their communities and
topics of discussion associated with them. With this data, we present a
machine learning framework for social media users classification which
detects users that swing from their closed community to another one. A
feature importance analysis in three Twitter polarized political datasets
showed that these users have low values of PageRank, suggesting that
changes in community are driven because their messages have no reso-
nance in their original communities.
